# Python for Finance: A CA Student's Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress and code examples from the **Python for Finance course by Robot Traders**. As a CA Final student, my goal is to bridge the gap between financial theory and practical application by learning Python programming and its powerful libraries for finance.

### About the Project

This project serves as a structured log of my learning, starting from fundamental Python syntax and progressing to more complex financial modeling and data manipulation. The notebooks contain code, calculations, and explanations that demonstrate how programming can be used to solve real-world financial problems, from personal finance to portfolio management.

### Key Concepts Covered

The notebooks in this repository cover the following topics:

**Chapter 1: Variables, Types, and Operations**
* **Fundamental Data Types:** Working with integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
* **Mathematical Operations:** Performing calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Complex Financial Calculations:** Solving problems related to capital gains, including the calculation of total value, average purchase price, and tax liabilities in different jurisdictions like France and Belgium.

**Chapter 2: Control Flow**
* **`for` Loops:** Automating repetitive tasks, such as simulating monthly savings.
* **`while` Loops:** Creating dynamic processes, such as calculating the time it takes for an investment to double or reach a specific savings goal.
* **Conditional Statements:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions in code, such as executing buy, sell, or hold actions based on a stock's price.

**Chapter 3: Data Structures**
* **Lists:** Storing and manipulating ordered collections of data, like a list of assets.
* **Dictionaries:** Storing data in key-value pairs to represent complex information, such as stock details or asset information.
* **Nested Data Structures:** Creating advanced structures like a dictionary of dictionaries to manage a full portfolio, enabling the calculation of profit and loss (PnL) and average purchase price.

### How to View the Files

The code is organized into Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`). To view and run the notebooks, you will need to have Jupyter installed. You can also view them directly on GitHub's interface.
